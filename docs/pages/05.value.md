# Value

---

`Animated.Value`s are just containers for numbers and most nodes like `abs`, `sin`, `lessThan`, `color`, etc use them as input to various nodes.
They can hold numbers, boolean, `undefined`, and other nodes.
You create it by:

```js
const v = new Value(/*initial value*/);
```

Worth noting that boolean values are represented by 0 and 1, so `lessThan(new Value(5), new Value(8))` returns `Value(1)`.
`Value` has a backward compatible `setValue()` with React Native's Animated:

```js
const v = new Value(0);
/// ...
v.setValue(100);
```
