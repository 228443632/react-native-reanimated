# Blocks

---

Blocks are just arrays of nodes that are being evaluated in a particular order and return the value of the last node. It can be created using `block` command but also when passed as an argument to other nodes the `block` command can be omitted and we can just pass a nodes array directly. See an example below:

```js
const tmp = new Value(0);
const a = new Value(1);
const b = new Value(5);

// ...

block([set(tmp, a), set(a, b), set(b, tmp)]);
```

Block above swaps contents of two Values and returns value of`b`.

Passing array directly is equivalent to wrapping it with the `block` command.
