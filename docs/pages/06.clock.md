# Clocks

---

Original `Animated` API makes an "animation" object a first class citizen.
`Animation` object has many features and therefore requires quite a few JS<>Native bridge methods to be managed properly.
In `react-native-reanimated`, clocks aim to replace that by providing more of a low level abstraction but also since clock nodes behave much like the animated values they make the implementation much less complex.

`Animated.Clock` are new thing in comparison to Animated library. They don't hold value, but current frame timestamp in milliseconds which allows to avoid rounds between JS and native side via RN's bridge.
Few nodes using clocks as input: `startClock`, `clockRunning`, `timing`.
When we take `Clock` node as an input, the value it returns is the current frame timestamp in milliseconds.
Because `Animated.Clock` just extends the `Animated.Value` you can use it in the same places (operations) where you can pass any type of animated node.
